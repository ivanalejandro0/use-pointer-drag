# Examples
Here you can find a very basic app created to showcase some of the components
you can easily build using this library.

Examples are live [here](https://ivanalejandro0.github.io/use-pointer-drag/).

You can also open this on online IDEs, like:
* [![Open in StackBlitz](https://developer.stackblitz.com/img/open_in_stackblitz.svg)](https://stackblitz.com/github/ivanalejandro0/use-pointer-drag/tree/main/apps/examples?file=src/examples/ImageSideSplit/index.tsx)
* [![Open in CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/static/img/play-codesandbox.svg)](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/ivanalejandro0/use-pointer-drag/tree/main/apps/examples?file=/src/examples/TimeIndicator/index.tsx)

Note: last time I tried there seemed to be a problem with CodeSandbox getting
types from the package, so I'd recommend using StackBlitz or checking out the
live demo. I've linked to CodeSandbox anyways so you have the option.
